## May 31

It is my first hardware project. I have been thinking of trying out onboard since I joined hackclub, but I never got a chance.
I think this highways is my best shot. I am currently planning and synthesizing stuff. I wanted something original that's why I didn't start with the starter project.
I am currently vetting my plans. I have a solid Idea already thanks to my buddy that knows a lot about hardware :)
I will be frank I have an AI partner that helps me in brainstorming. My journal is original, and this is just the beginning.

I am done with my plans, but I gotta still research parts that are needed. 
I was confused at first thinking we need to make the full project before submitting. I have to check the highway guidelines once more
and I think I just have to design and make BOM. I set up the MicroPico extension on vs code and switch stubs to ES32. 
I will be using python instead of C++ until. I will switch when I am more comfortable with my shitty skills in C++. I suck at it.
I faced some errors initially and I find out it's fine since the hardware ai't connected.
