## May 31

It is my first hardware project. I have been thinking of trying out onboard since I joined hackclub, but I never got a chance.
I think this highways is my best shot. I am currently planning and synthesizing stuff. I wanted something original that's why I didn't start with the starter project.
I am currently vetting my plans. I have a solid Idea already thanks to my buddy that knows a lot about hardware :)
I will be frank I have an AI partner that helps me in brainstorming. My journal is original, and this is just the beginning. 

[No Image today ;0]

spend 2hrs

I am done with my plans, but I gotta still research parts that are needed. 
I was confused at first thinking we need to make the full project before submitting. I have to check the highway guidelines once more
and I think I just have to design and make BOM. I set up the MicroPico extension on vs code and switch stubs to ES32. 
I will be using python instead of C++ until. I will switch when I am more comfortable with my shitty skills in C++. I suck at it.
I faced some errors initially and I find out it's fine since the hardware ai't connected.

I started coding some firmware offline for now. I made pomodoro logic and idk if i's gonna work that well but I made it just in case.

A sneak peak hehe
I will check if my plan needs change but for now see ya tmr

## June 02

I started today with a block diagram of how I will connect my stuffs. I started sketching on my journal
I then remember excalidraw and I immediately discard my journal to use it. I did some research initially, 
and thanks to AI for clarifying things. I spent an hour and half making the block diagram. I ensure it's readable
I spent extra 10 mins taking out useless aesthetics I add like colors.

I love this block diagram. it is pretty ngl. it wasn't easy stopping at this hehe
After I tested my shitty code and as expected a bit buggy. I ran some test and confirm some issues with my logic and I made some fixes.
I spent 2 hrs debugging as I added like 20 print statement just to get the exact error location. I did spent extra time cleaning the 
print statement. I ran the last test and yay it's working from python's end :|
Now I make the main orchestrator which is the main_controller.py
it was easier to implement as mostly it is place holders and part of pomodoro logic. 
I am cworking in parallel cuz I just made my BOM template on google doc. I cover some part as it was just rough hehe
