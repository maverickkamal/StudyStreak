## May 31

It is my first hardware project. I have been thinking of trying out onboard since I joined hackclub, but I never got a chance.
I think this highways is my best shot. I am currently planning and synthesizing stuff. I wanted something original that's why I didn't start with the starter project.
I am currently vetting my plans. I have a solid Idea already thanks to my buddy that knows a lot about hardware :)
I will be frank I have an AI partner that helps me in brainstorming. My journal is original, and this is just the beginning.
